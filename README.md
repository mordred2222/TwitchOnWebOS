# Welcome to Twitch.TV!
I started the project, when i got a LG WebOS TV.

I wanted to watch stream on the TV, i had to connect it to my pc, and see the stream that way though.

I did that a few times, until it started to piss me off, so i started to look into, how to make my own Twitch.TV app, for the WebOS. It turned out it wasn't that complicated, so i stat down, and started the project.

## Installation instructions
If you want to try out the app for your self, you can just follow these steps.

* Download latest zip from https://leweb.be/twitch-on-webos/ 
* Copy it to an USB key.
* Attach your flash drive to the tv.
* Find app in the smart menu.
